## About Me
I'm currently a research intern at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research [(TIFR) Mumbai](https://main.tifr.res.in/). My interests include ultrafast and nonlinear optics and laser-matter interaction.


My recent activities in the [UPHILL](https://www.tifr.res.in/~uphill/) group at TIFR include measurement of nonlinear optical response of materials using a new approach that acquires the 2-dimensional phase of the beam as it crosses the sample. I have also been involved in experiments that use the same phase acquirement technique to capture [picosecond dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02403) of laser-generated plasma mirrors.
