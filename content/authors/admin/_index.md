    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
I'm currently a research intern at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research ([TIFR) Mumbai](https://main.tifr.res.in/). My interests include ultrafast optics, nonlinear optics and laser-matter interaction.  
My recent activities with the [UPHILL](https://www.tifr.res.in/~uphill/) group at TIFR include measurement of nonlinear optical response of materials using a new approach that acquires spatial phase of the beam as it crosses the sample. I have also been involved in experiments that use the same phase acquirement technique to capture [picosecond dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02403) of laser-generated plasma mirrors.
