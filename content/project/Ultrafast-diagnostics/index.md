We observe the dynamics of expansion of a femtosecond laser-generated plasma in the picosecond time scale by measuring its speed of expansion using Doppler spectroscopy. This study gives insights into the propagation of shocks in the plasma. 

We also record optical imprints of the laser ponderomotive force by observing curvature of the plasma's critical density surface at various intensities. This curvature has implications in laser-absorption processes and growth of instabilities in the plasma.
